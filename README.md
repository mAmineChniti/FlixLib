# FlixLib

This project is an ongoing demo for learning Go and HTMX by creating a watchlist library for movies and TV shows. We are building a simple application to understand the basics and advanced concepts of both technologies.

## Technologies Used

- Go: A statically typed, compiled language with syntax similar to C that is designed to be simple and efficient.
- HTMX: A modern HTML-first approach to building web applications, allowing you to access AJAX, CSS Transitions, WebSockets and Server Sent Events directly in HTML.
